# Installation & Setup

Get jj running on your system and initialize your first repository.

## Installing jj

<Tabs defaultTab="macos" persistKey="os">
  <Tab id="macos" label="macOS">
    ```bash
    brew install jj
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab id="linux" label="Linux">
    ```bash
    cargo install jj-cli
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

Or download a binary from [github.com/jj-vcs/jj/releases](https://github.com/jj-vcs/jj/releases).

## Verify Installation

```bash
jj --version
```

You should see version output like `jj 0.20.1`.

## Colocated Repositories

jj can work **alongside git** in the same repository. This is called a "colocated" repository.

**In an existing git repo:**
```bash
cd my-project
jj git init --colocate
```

This creates `.jj/` directory alongside `.git/`. Your git history is preserved and can still be used with git commands.

**Start fresh (new repo):**
```bash
mkdir new-project
cd new-project
jj git init
```

<TryIt command="jj git init --colocate" description="Initialize a colocated jj repository in the sandbox" setup={[]} />

<Callout type="tip">
jj stores all its data in the `.jj/` directory. You can always delete it to remove jj without affecting your git repository.
</Callout>

## Verify Setup

```bash
jj status
```

If successful, you'll see "No working copy changes" or similar status output.

<TryIt command="jj status" description="Check the repository status" />

## Next Steps

With jj installed, let's explore the fundamental mental model difference between git and jj.
