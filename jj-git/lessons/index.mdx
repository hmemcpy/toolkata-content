# Why jj over git?

**jj (Jujutsu)** is a version control system that treats your working copy as a commit. No staging area. Automatic rebasing. First-class conflicts.

## Key Differences from git

### Working Copy IS a Commit

In git, you have working copy changes, staged changes, and commits. In jj, your working copy **is** a commit (the `@` commit). Changes are auto-tracked.

### No Staging Area

Forget `git add` and `git commit`. In jj, you just `jj describe` to name your current commit, then `jj new` to start the next one.

### Change IDs Survive Rebases

Every commit gets a stable change ID that survives rebases. This makes collaboration safer—your commits remain the same logical changes even as history is rewritten.

### Conflicts Are First-Class

Conflicts are stored in commits, not blocking errors. You can continue working, view conflicts, and resolve them when ready.

### Automatic Descendant Rebasing

When you edit an old commit, all descendants automatically rebase. No more `git rebase --update-refs` or manual branch updates.

## Compatible with git

jj works with existing git repositories. Use `jj git init` to colocate, or `jj git clone` to start fresh. Push and pull with git remotes using `jj git push` and `jj git fetch`.

You can even use both tools on the same repository—git and jj understand each other's commits.

## Who Should Use jj?

- **git users who want safer workflows**—jj never loses data
- **Teams that rebase often**—automatic descendant rebasing
- **Developers who fear merge conflicts**—first-class conflict handling
- **Anyone who wants a simpler mental model**—working copy as a commit
