# Your First Commits

Making commits in jj is different from git—there's no staging area to manage.

## The jj Commit Workflow

In jj, commits are created in two steps:

1. **`jj describe`** - Name/edit the current `@` commit
2. **`jj new`** - Finalize `@` and create a new empty commit

<SideBySide
  validate={false}
  fromCommands={[
    "echo \"hello\" > file.txt",
    "git add file.txt",
    "git commit -m \"Add file\"",
  ]}
  toCommands={[
    "echo \"hello\" > file.txt",
    "jj describe -m \"Add file\"",
    "jj new",
  ]}
/>

## Understanding `jj describe`

`jj describe` edits the **current** `@` commit's message. It doesn't create a new commit.

```bash
# Edit the @ commit message
jj describe -m "Initial implementation"

# Or open editor
jj describe

# See the updated message
jj show @
```

## Understanding `jj new`

`jj new` finalizes the current `@` commit and creates a new `@` commit on top of it.

```bash
# Current @ commit has changes
jj status

# Finalize it, create new @
jj new

# Now @ is empty (no changes yet)
jj status
```

## Step-by-Step Example

Let's create three commits:

```bash
# 1. Start with a clean slate
jj new
# Working copy now at @

# 2. Create first file and commit
echo "console.log('hello')" > app.js
jj describe -m "Add hello world"
jj new

# 3. Create second file and commit
echo "export const x = 42" > config.js
jj describe -m "Add config"
jj new

# 4. Modify existing file
echo "console.log('hello world')" >> app.js
jj describe -m "Update greeting"
jj new
```

## Editing the Last Commit

Need to change the last commit message?

<SideBySide
  fromCommands={[
    "git commit --amend -m \"New message\"",
  ]}
  toCommands={[
    "jj describe -m \"New message\"",
  ]}
/>

If you've already run `jj new` and want to edit the previous commit:

```bash
# Edit the parent of @
jj edit @-

# Now @ is that commit
jj describe -m "Corrected message"

# Create new @ to finalize
jj new
```

## Viewing Your Commits

```bash
# Show current @ commit
jj show @

# Show commit history
jj log

# Show parent commit
jj show @-
```

## What About `git add`?

In jj, there's no `jj add` command. All file changes are automatically part of the `@` commit.

<SideBySide
  validate={false}
  fromCommands={[
    "vim a.js",
    "vim b.js",
    "vim c.js",
    "git add a.js",
    "git add b.js",
    "git commit -m \"Partial commit\"",
  ]}
  toCommands={[
    "vim a.js",
    "vim b.js",
    "vim c.js",
    "jj status",
  ]}
/>

<Callout type="note">
jj's philosophy is that it's better to create separate commits for different changes, then use `jj squash` or `jj rebase` to reorganize. This avoids the complexity of selective staging.
</Callout>

## Common Patterns

**Quick commit cycle:**
```bash
# Make changes
vim file.js

# Commit
jj describe -m "Fix bug"
jj new
```

**Forget to describe before `jj new`:**
```bash
# Made changes, ran jj new too soon
jj new
# Oops, commit message is empty

# Fix it
jj edit @-
jj describe -m "The message I meant"
jj new
```

**Multiple edits before finalizing:**
```bash
# Make changes
vim app.js

# Describe
jj describe -m "Add feature"

# Make more changes
vim config.js

# Update description
jj describe -m "Add feature and config"

# Finally commit
jj new
```

## Try It Yourself

<TryIt command="jj new" description="Create a new working copy commit" />

<TryIt command="echo 'test' > demo.txt" description="Create a demo file" />

<TryIt command="jj describe -m 'Add demo file'" description="Name your commit" />

<TryIt command="jj show @" description="Check the current commit" />

<TryIt command="jj new" description="Finalize and create new commit" />

<TryIt command="jj log" description="Verify in history" />

## Key Takeaways

- `jj describe` edits the current `@` commit message
- `jj new` finalizes `@` and creates a new empty commit
- No staging area—all changes are auto-tracked
- Edit previous commits with `jj edit @-`

## Next Steps

Now that you can create commits, let's explore how jj handles branching differently from git.
