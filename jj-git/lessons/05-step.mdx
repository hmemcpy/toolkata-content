# Viewing History and Diffs

jj provides powerful tools for exploring history and comparing changes.

## Viewing History

<SideBySide
  fromCommands={[
    "git log",
  ]}
  toCommands={[
    "jj log",
  ]}
/>

## Log Options

<SideBySide
  fromCommands={[
    "git log --oneline",
    "git log -n 10",
    "git log --graph --oneline",
  ]}
  toCommands={[
    "jj log -l 10",
  ]}
/>

## Understanding the Log Output

In jj's log:
- `@` = Your working copy commit
- `◉` = Regular commits
- `◌` = Abandoned commits
- `@` appears in the log as the latest commit

```bash
$ jj log
@  xyzkpznx test 123
◉  prklqyso test foo
◉  roqmyuqs test bar
◉  yostqsxx qux
```

## Viewing Commit Details

<SideBySide
  fromCommands={[
    "git show HEAD",
  ]}
  toCommands={[
    "jj show @",
  ]}
/>

## Viewing Diffs

<SideBySide
  fromCommands={[
    "git diff",
    "git diff app.js",
    "git diff HEAD~1 HEAD",
  ]}
  toCommands={[
    "jj diff",
    "jj diff app.js",
    "jj diff --from @- --to @",
  ]}
/>

## Diff Syntax

jj uses `--from` and `--to` for precise diff control:

```bash
# Compare @ with parent
jj diff --from @- --to @

# Compare two commits
jj diff --from abc --to def

# Compare with main
jj diff --from main --to @

# See what changed since main
jj diff --from main
```

## Common Diff Patterns

**What changed in my working copy?**
```bash
jj diff
```

**What's different between two branches?**
```bash
jj diff --from main --to feature
```

**Show me the changes in this commit:**
```bash
jj show abc
# or
jj diff --from abc^- --to abc
```

**What files are modified?**
```bash
jj status
```

## The Status Command

<SideBySide
  fromCommands={[
    "git status",
  ]}
  toCommands={[
    "jj status",
  ]}
/>

## Interactive History

jj's log is more than just text—it's an interactive history:

```bash
# View log with more details
jj log -v

# Show change IDs
jj log --change-id

# Show commit timestamps
jj log --timestamps
```

## Comparing Files

<SideBySide
  fromCommands={[
    "git diff HEAD app.js",
    "git diff branch1 branch2 app.js",
  ]}
  toCommands={[
    "jj diff app.js",
    "jj diff --from branch1 --to branch2 app.js",
  ]}
/>

## Operations Log

jj maintains an operation log—useful for undoing:

```bash
# Show operation history
jj op log

# Output:
# 0123 minutes ago: checkout
# 0456 minutes ago: new
# 0789 minutes ago: describe
```

## Try It Yourself

<TryIt command="echo 'test' > test.txt && echo 'demo' > demo.txt" description="Make some changes" />

<TryIt command="jj diff" description="See what changed" />

<TryIt command="jj describe -m 'Add files'" description="Name the commit" />

<TryIt command="jj new" description="Finalize the commit" />

<TryIt command="jj show @-" description="View the previous commit" />

<TryIt command="jj log" description="See history" />

## Key Takeaways

- `jj log` shows commit history with `@` marking working copy
- `jj diff` shows @ vs parent (use `--from/--to` for more)
- `jj show` displays full commit details
- `jj status` shows pending changes
- `jj op log` shows operation history for undo

## Next Steps

Now let's explore how jj handles remote operations differently from git.
