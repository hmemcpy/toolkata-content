# First-Class Conflict Handling

jj treats conflicts as first-class objects—stored in commits, not blocking errors that halt your workflow.

## Git's Conflict Model

In git, conflicts block everything:

```bash
git merge feature
# CONFLICT: file.js

# Can't commit until resolved
git status
# both modified: file.js

# Must resolve before continuing
vim file.js
git add file.js
git commit
```

## jj's Conflict Model

In jj, conflicts live in commits. You can continue working, view them, and resolve when ready.

```bash
jj new @ feature
# Conflict recorded in @

# Can still work
jj status
# Shows conflicts

# Can commit @ with conflicts
jj describe -m "Merge with conflicts"
jj new

# Resolve later
jj resolve
```

## Viewing Conflicts

<SideBySide
  fromCommands={[
    "git status",
  ]}
  toCommands={[
    "jj status",
  ]}
/>

## Resolving Conflicts

<SideBySide
  validate={false}
  fromCommands={[
    "vim app.js",
    "git add app.js",
    "git commit",
  ]}
  toCommands={[
    "vim app.js",
    "jj resolve app.js",
    "jj resolve app.js",
  ]}
/>

## Continuing with Conflicts

In jj, you can commit with conflicts and resolve later:

```bash
# Merge creates conflict
jj new @ feature

# Commit the conflict state
jj describe -m "Merged with conflicts in app.js"
jj new

# Continue working on other files
vim other.js
jj describe -m "Work on other file"
jj new

# Come back to resolve later
jj edit --change <commit-with-conflict>
jj resolve
```

<Callout type="tip">
This is powerful for complex merges—resolve conflicts in batches, not all at once.
</Callout>

## Conflict Materialization

When you have conflicts, jj shows them in files:

```bash
# jj creates conflict markers
$ cat app.js
<<<<<<< Left
const x = 1;
=======
const x = 2;
>>>>>>> Right
```

But the conflict is also stored in commit metadata:

```bash
$ jj show @
Conflict in app.js:
  Left: abc (our change)
  Right: def (their change)
  Base: 123 (original)
```

## Multiple Conflicts

<SideBySide
  validate={false}
  fromCommands={[
    "git merge feature",
  ]}
  toCommands={[
    "jj new @ feature",
    "jj resolve file1",
    "jj resolve",
    "jj describe -m \"Partial merge\"",
    "jj new",
  ]}
/>

## Abandoning Merges

<SideBySide
  validate={false}
  fromCommands={[
    "git merge --abort",
  ]}
  toCommands={[
    "jj abandon @",
    "jj op undo",
  ]}
/>

## Rebase Conflicts

Even with jj's automatic rebasing, conflicts can occur:

```bash
jj rebase -d main@origin
# Conflict in app.js

# Resolve and continue
jj resolve app.js
jj rebase --continue
```

But since jj auto-rebases descendants, you only resolve once:

<SideBySide
  validate={false}
  fromCommands={[
    "git rebase -i HEAD~5",
    "git add .",
    "git rebase --continue",
  ]}
  toCommands={[
    "jj rebase -d @-",
    "jj resolve",
  ]}
/>

## Conflict Resolution Tools

<SideBySide
  validate={false}
  fromCommands={[
    "git mergetool",
  ]}
  toCommands={[
    "jj resolve --list",
    "jj resolve file.js",
  ]}
/>

## Visualizing Conflicts

```bash
# See which files have conflicts
jj status

# Show conflict details
jj show @

# Show just conflicts
jj diff --conflict
```

## Try It Yourself

<TryIt command="jj status" description="Check for any conflicts" />

<TryIt command="jj log" description="View commit history" />

## Key Takeaways

- Conflicts are stored in commits, not blocking errors
- `jj resolve` marks conflicts as resolved
- Can commit with conflicts and resolve later
- `jj resolve --list` shows all conflicts
- Auto-rebasing means resolve conflicts once
- `jj op undo` to abandon problematic merges
