# The Basics

Practice the fundamental jj commands: status, log, describe, and new.

## Scenario

You're working on a new project and need to commit your initial changes. The repository has been initialized with one commit.

## Exercise 1: Check repository status

Check the current state of your working copy.

<TryIt command="jj status" description="Check the repository status" />

The output shows:
- The parent commit of your working copy
- Any uncommitted changes (currently none)
- The working copy commit ID

## Exercise 2: View commit history

View all commits in the repository.

<TryIt command="jj log" description="View all commits" />

The output shows:
- Each commit with its change ID
- The commit message
- The timestamp
- The `@` symbol marks your working copy commit

## Exercise 3: Name the working copy commit

Your working copy currently has the default message. Change it to something descriptive.

<TryIt command="jj describe -m 'Initial commit'" description="Name the @ commit" />

<TryIt command="jj show @" description="Verify the description" />

The `jj show @` command displays the current working copy commit with its new description.

## Exercise 4: Create a new commit

Create a file and commit it.

<TryIt command="echo 'hello world' > README.md" description="Create a README file" />

<TryIt command="jj status" description="Check the status (shows file change)" />

<TryIt command="jj describe -m 'Add README'" description="Name the commit" />

<TryIt command="jj new" description="Finalize and create new @" />

After `jj new`, your previous working copy becomes a permanent commit, and a new empty working copy is created as `@`.

## Key Points

- `jj status` shows working copy state and parent commit
- `jj log` displays all commits in the repository
- `jj describe -m "message"` names the `@` commit
- `jj new` finalizes `@` and creates a new empty working copy

## Completion Checklist

- [ ] Ran `jj status` to check repository state
- [ ] Ran `jj log` to view commit history (at least 2 commits)
- [ ] Used `jj describe` to name the working copy commit
- [ ] Created a new commit with `jj new` (at least 3 commits total)
