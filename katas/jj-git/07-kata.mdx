# The Full Flow Challenge

A complete scenario combining all the jj techniques you've learned: commits, bookmarks, conflicts, history editing, and rebasing.

## Scenario

You're implementing a new feature for a project. You'll start from scratch, create a feature branch, make commits, encounter and resolve a conflict, edit history, and rebase onto main.

## Exercise 1: Initialize repository and make initial commits

Set up a new repository with base commits.

<TryIt command="jj git init" description="Initialize a new jj repo" />

<TryIt command="echo '# My Project' > README.md" description="Create README" />

<TryIt command="jj describe -m 'Add README'" description="Name commit" />

<TryIt command="jj new" description="Commit" />

<TryIt command={`echo 'console.log("hello")' > app.js`} description="Create app file" />

<TryIt command="jj describe -m 'Add app'" description="Name commit" />

<TryIt command="jj new" description="Commit" />

<TryIt command="echo 'export const PORT = 3000' > config.js" description="Create config" />

<TryIt command="jj describe -m 'Add config'" description="Name commit" />

<TryIt command="jj new" description="Commit" />

<TryIt command="jj log" description="Verify 3 commits exist" />

## Exercise 2: Create a bookmark and start a feature

Create a feature bookmark and start working on a new feature.

<TryIt command="jj bookmark create main" description="Create main bookmark" />

<TryIt command="jj bookmark create feature" description="Create feature bookmark" />

<TryIt command={`echo 'export function hello() { return "hi" }' > utils.js`} description="Add utility function" />

<TryIt command="jj describe -m 'Add hello utility'" description="Name commit" />

<TryIt command="jj new" description="Commit" />

<TryIt command="echo 'export const PORT = 8080' > config.js" description="Change config port" />

<TryIt command="jj describe -m 'Update port'" description="Name commit" />

<TryIt command="jj new" description="Commit" />

<TryIt command="jj bookmark list" description="Verify feature bookmark exists" />

## Exercise 3: Edit history and resolve conflicts

Modify earlier commits and handle any conflicts that arise.

<TryIt command="jj edit @-" description="Move to parent commit" />

<TryIt command={`echo 'export const HOST = "localhost"' >> config.js`} description="Add host config" />

<TryIt command="jj describe -m 'Add host config'" description="Name edited commit" />

<TryIt command="jj new" description="Create new @ commit" />

<TryIt command="echo '// TODO: add error handling' >> utils.js" description="Add comment" />

<TryIt command="jj describe -m 'Add TODO comment'" description="Name commit" />

<TryIt command="jj new" description="Commit" />

<TryIt command="jj status" description="Verify clean working copy" />

## Exercise 4: Rebase feature and complete workflow

Rebase your feature onto main and finalize.

<TryIt command="jj rebase -d main --source feature-" description="Rebase feature onto main" />

<TryIt command="jj log" description="Verify rebased history (6+ commits)" />

<TryIt command="jj status" description="Check final state" />

<TryIt command="jj bookmark list" description="Verify bookmarks are correct" />

## Key Points

- `jj git init` creates a new repository
- Bookmarks track branch points
- `jj edit @` lets you modify past commits
- `jj rebase -d` moves commits to new parents
- History is mutable and always correctable

## Completion Checklist

- [ ] Initialized repository with 3+ base commits
- [ ] Created and verified feature bookmark
- [ ] Edited commit history and resolved conflicts
- [ ] Rebased feature onto main (6+ commits total)
- [ ] Verified clean working copy state

Congratulations on completing all 7 Katas! You now have hands-on practice with the core jj workflows. From here, try using jj in your real projects—the `jj git` commands make it easy to work alongside existing git repositories.
