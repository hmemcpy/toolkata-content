# Bookmarks Mastery

Practice creating and managing bookmarks—jj's equivalent to git branches.

## Scenario

You're working on a feature and need to create bookmarks to track different points in your commit history. Bookmarks in jj move automatically as you commit, unlike git branches which stay fixed.

## Exercise 1: Create a new bookmark

Create a bookmark pointing to the current `@` commit.

<TryIt command="jj bookmark create my-feature" description="Create a bookmark named my-feature" />

<TryIt command="jj bookmark list" description="List all bookmarks" />

Bookmarks are named references to commits. Unlike git branches, bookmarks in jj move automatically when you create new commits.

## Exercise 2: Set bookmark to a specific commit

Move a bookmark to point to a different commit.

<TryIt command="jj bookmark set my-feature --revision=rsvkpznx" description="Set bookmark to specific commit" />

<TryIt command="jj show my-feature" description="Verify bookmark location" />

<TryIt command="jj log" description="See commit graph with bookmarks" />

The `--revision` flag lets you point a bookmark to any commit in history, not just the current `@`.

## Exercise 3: Rename a bookmark

Rename an existing bookmark to a new name.

<TryIt command="jj bookmark rename my-feature my-feature-renamed" description="Rename the bookmark" />

<TryIt command="jj bookmark list" description="Verify the rename" />

Renaming bookmarks is a common operation when refactoring branch names or updating naming conventions.

## Exercise 4: Delete a bookmark

Remove a bookmark that's no longer needed.

<TryIt command="jj bookmark forget my-feature-renamed" description="Delete the bookmark" />

<TryIt command="jj bookmark list" description="Verify it's gone" />

The `forget` subcommand removes the bookmark but doesn't delete any commits.

## Exercise 5: List all bookmarks

Show all bookmarks with their locations.

<TryIt command="jj bookmark list" description="List all bookmarks" />

The output shows each bookmark name and the commit it points to. You can use `-r` for a raw format or `--all` to show all bookmarks including remote-tracking ones.

## Key Points

- `jj bookmark create <name>` creates a bookmark at `@`
- `jj bookmark set <name> -r <commit>` moves bookmark to specific commit
- `jj bookmark rename <old> <new>` renames a bookmark
- `jj bookmark forget <name>` deletes a bookmark
- `jj bookmark list` shows all bookmarks

## Completion Checklist

- [ ] Created bookmark "my-feature"
- [ ] Set bookmark to specific commit
- [ ] Renamed bookmark to "my-feature-renamed"
- [ ] Deleted bookmark with `jj bookmark forget`
- [ ] Listed all bookmarks (at least 2 remaining)
