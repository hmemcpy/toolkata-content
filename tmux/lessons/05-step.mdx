# Key Bindings

tmux key bindings follow a simple pattern: **prefix + command**.

The prefix key (default `Ctrl-b`) tells tmux "the next key is for tmux, not the shell". After pressing prefix, you have about 1 second to press the command key.

<Callout type="tip">
Think of prefix like `Alt` or `Ctrl` in other apps — it modifies the meaning of the next keypress.
</Callout>

## The prefix key

Default: `Ctrl-b`

1. Press and hold `Ctrl`
2. Press `b`
3. Release both
4. Press the command key

Example: `Ctrl-b d` (detach)

<Callout type="warning">
`Ctrl-b` is awkward for many — it requires reaching. We'll remap it in Step 7.
</Callout>

## Why Ctrl-b?

GNU screen (tmux's predecessor) uses `Ctrl-a`. tmux chose `Ctrl-b` because:

- `Ctrl-a` is commonly used for "beginning of line" in shell readline
- `Ctrl-b` is "backward one character" (less common)

Many users remap to `Ctrl-a` anyway (or `Ctrl-space`, `Ctrl-q`).

## Listing all key bindings

Show every key binding:

<TryIt command="Ctrl-b ?" />

This opens a scrollable list. Use arrow keys or page up/down to browse.

<Callout type="tip">
Press `q` or `Esc` to exit the help list.
</Callout>

## From command line

List all bindings:

<TryIt command="tmux list-keys" />

List bindings containing a specific key:

<TryIt command="tmux list-keys | grep -i split" />

## Command mode

Enter command mode:

<TryIt command="Ctrl-b :" />

You can type any tmux command by name. Tab-completion works!

Examples:
- `new-session -s mysession`
- `split-window -v`
- `rename-window tests`

<Callout type="tip">
Command mode is powerful. If there's no key binding for something, there's probably a command for it.
</Callout>

## Common prefix commands

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `d` | Detach from session |
| `?` | List key bindings |
| `:` | Command prompt |
| `[` | Enter copy mode (scroll) |
| `]` | Paste from buffer |
| `=` | Choose buffer to paste |
| `~` | Show paste buffers |

## Session commands

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `s` | List sessions |
| `$` | Rename session |
| `(` | Switch to previous session |
| `)` | Switch to next session |
| `L` | Switch to last session |

## Window commands

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `c` | Create new window |
| `w` | Choose window |
| `n` | Next window |
| `p` | Previous window |
| `0-9` | Jump to window number |
| `,` | Rename window |
| `&` | Kill window |
| `f` | Find window |
| `F` | Find window by name |

## Pane commands

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `%` | Split vertical (left/right) |
| `"` | Split horizontal (top/bottom) |
| `o` | Cycle panes |
| `q` | Show pane numbers |
| `x` | Kill pane |
| `z` | Zoom pane |
| `!` | Break pane to window |
| `{` | Swap pane with previous |
| `}` | Swap pane with next |
| `;` | Last active pane |
| `o` | Rotate panes forward |

## Copy mode commands

Enter copy mode with `Ctrl-b [`, then:

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `↑↓` | Scroll line by line |
| `Ctrl-b` / `Ctrl-f` | Scroll page up/down |
| `g` | Go to top |
| `G` | Go to bottom |
| `/` | Search forward |
| `?` | Search backward |
| `Space` | Start selection |
| `Enter` | Copy selection |
| `q` / `Esc` | Exit copy mode |

<Callout type="tip">
Copy mode uses vi keys by default. Emacs mode is available (we'll cover in Step 7).
</Callout>

## Nested tmux

When you attach to a tmux inside tmux (common with SSH), you need to send prefix to the inner session:

<TryIt command="Ctrl-b Ctrl-b" />

This sends `Ctrl-b` to the inner tmux.

<Callout type="warning">
Nested tmux can be confusing. Consider using `Ctrl-a` for local, `Ctrl-b` for remote.
</Callout>

## Key binding modes

tmux has two modes for key bindings:
- **emacs** (default): emacs-style movement
- **vi**: vi-style movement

Check current mode:

<TryIt command="tmux show-options -g | grep status-keys" />

## Listing options

Show all options:

<TryIt command="tmux show-options -g" />

Show specific option:

<TryIt command="tmux show-options -g | grep prefix" />

## Key binding table

Key bindings are organized into **key tables**:
- **root**: Default prefix bindings
- **copy-mode**: Bindings in copy mode
- **choice-mode**: Interactive selection bindings
- **edit-mode**: Command line editing

View bindings in a specific table:

<TryIt command="tmux list-keys -T copy-mode" />

## Custom key bindings

Create temporary binding:

<TryIt command="Ctrl-b :" />

Type: `bind-key X kill-session`

Now `Ctrl-b X` kills the current session.

<Callout type="warning">
Temporary bindings are lost when tmux exits. For permanent bindings, use `.tmux.conf` (Step 7).
</Callout>

## Unbinding keys

Remove a key binding:

<TryIt command="Ctrl-b :" />

Type: `unbind-key %`

Now `Ctrl-b %` (split vertical) does nothing.

## Viewing bound command

Find what a key does:

<TryIt command="tmux list-keys | grep 'prefix %'" />

Output: `bind-key -T root % split-window -h`

## Next steps

Now that you understand key bindings, you can customize them. In **Step 7**, we'll create a `.tmux.conf` file to:
- Remap prefix to `Ctrl-a`
- Add sensible key bindings
- Enable vi mode
- Customize the status bar

<Callout type="tip">
Memorize 5-10 key bindings you use daily. Look up the rest as needed.
</Callout>
