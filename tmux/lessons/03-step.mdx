# Windows

A tmux **window** is like a tab in your terminal browser. Windows live inside sessions and contain panes (which we'll cover next).

Each window can run a different program or command — vim in one, a server in another, tests in a third.

<Callout type="tip">
Think of the hierarchy: **session → window → pane**. Sessions contain windows, windows contain panes.
</Callout>

## Creating windows

Create a new window:

<TryIt command="Ctrl-b c" />

You're now in a fresh shell. The status line shows the new window:

```
[mysession] 0:bash  1:bash*
```

`1:bash*` is the new window (marked active with `*`).

Create multiple windows: `Ctrl-b c`, `Ctrl-b c`, `Ctrl-b c`...

<Callout type="tip">
Windows are numbered starting at 0. Create a window for each task: editor, server, tests, logs, database.
</Callout>

## Navigating between windows

Jump to a specific window by number:

<TryIt command="Ctrl-b 0" />
<TryIt command="Ctrl-b 1" />
<TryIt command="Ctrl-b 2" />

This is the fastest way to switch — memorize your window numbers.

Cycle through windows:

<TryIt command="Ctrl-b n" />  # next window
<TryIt command="Ctrl-b p" />  # previous window

<Callout type="tip">
`n` = next, `p` = previous. These work even if you have many windows.
</Callout>

## Interactive window selection

Show all windows and select:

<TryIt command="Ctrl-b w" />

Use arrow keys to navigate, Enter to select. This shows a preview of each window.

## Finding windows

Search for a window by name:

<TryIt command="Ctrl-b f" />

Type the window name (e.g., "server" or "tests"). tmux jumps to the first match.

## Renaming windows

By default, windows show the running program name (`bash`, `vim`, `node`). Give them meaningful names:

<TryIt command="Ctrl-b ," />

Type a name like `server` or `frontend-tests` and press Enter.

<Callout type="warning">
The comma binding is easy to forget. If it doesn't work, check that you're not in a nested tmux session (common when attaching to a remote tmux).
</Callout>

## Listing windows

From command line (outside tmux):

<TryIt command="tmux list-windows -t sessionname" />

From inside tmux (command prompt):

<TryIt command="Ctrl-b :" />
Then type: `list-windows`

## Closing windows

Close the current window:

<TryIt command="Ctrl-b &" />

Confirm with `y` to close.

Or just exit the shell:

<TryIt command="exit" />

<Callout type="tip">
Closing a window closes all panes inside it. Make sure you don't have important work running!
</Callout>

## Window layouts

Each window remembers its pane layout. When you switch away and back, the layout is preserved.

We'll cover panes in the next step, but remember: windows are containers for panes.

## Status line

The status line shows all windows in the current session:

```
[session] 0:vim  1:server  2:logs*  3:tests
```

- `vim` — window 0 running vim
- `server` — window 1 (unnamed, shows program)
- `logs*` — window 2, currently active (marked with `*`)
- `3` — window 3, number only

## Key bindings summary

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `Ctrl-b c` | Create new window |
| `Ctrl-b 0-9` | Jump to window number |
| `Ctrl-b n` | Next window |
| `Ctrl-b p` | Previous window |
| `Ctrl-b w` | Choose window interactively |
| `Ctrl-b f` | Find window by name |
| `Ctrl-b ,` | Rename window |
| `Ctrl-b &` | Kill (close) window |

## Command-line usage

From outside tmux:

```bash
# Create new window in session
tmux new-window -t sessionname -n "windowname"

# Select window
tmux select-window -t sessionname:2

# Rename window
tmux rename-window -t sessionname:1 "newname"

# List windows
tmux list-windows -t sessionname
```

<Callout type="tip">
Window identifiers are `sessionname:windownumber`. For example: `mysession:2` means window 2 in mysession.
</Callout>

## Practical example

Here's a typical development workflow:

```bash
# Start session
tmux new -s webdev

# Window 0: Editor (default)

# Window 1: Server
Ctrl-b c
npm run dev
Ctrl-b ,   # name it "server"

# Window 2: Tests
Ctrl-b c
npm test
Ctrl-b ,   # name it "tests"

# Window 3: Logs
Ctrl-b c
tail -f logs/app.log
Ctrl-b ,   # name it "logs"

# Navigate between them
Ctrl-b 0   # edit code
Ctrl-b 1   # check server
Ctrl-b 2   # run tests
Ctrl-b 3   # view logs
```

## Window numbers

When you close a window, the numbers don't shift. If you close window 1, windows 0, 2, 3 stay numbered that way.

New windows get the next available number (4 in this example).

<Callout type="warning">
This can be confusing. You might have windows 0, 2, 3, 5. Use `Ctrl-b w` (interactive list) instead of memorizing numbers if your session is chaotic.
</Callout>
