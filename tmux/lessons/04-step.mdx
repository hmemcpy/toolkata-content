# Panes

Panes are where tmux becomes powerful. A **pane** is a split section of a window — multiple shell sessions visible at once.

This is perfect for:
- Side-by-side code comparison
- Watching logs while editing code
- Running tests while developing
- SSH into multiple servers simultaneously

<Callout type="tip">
Panes are independent. Each has its own shell, working directory, and running programs.
</Callout>

## Splitting vertically

Split the current pane horizontally (top/bottom):

<TryIt command="Ctrl-b %" />

The `%` key is `Shift-5` on most keyboards. The window splits into two panes stacked vertically.

## Splitting horizontally

Split the current pane vertically (left/right):

<TryIt command="Ctrl-b "` />

The `"` key is `Shift-'`. The window splits into two panes side by side.

<Callout type="warning">
`"` requires Shift. A common mistake is pressing just the quote key.
</Callout>

## Navigating between panes

Move to the next pane:

<TryIt command="Ctrl-b o" />

This cycles through all panes in the current window.

Jump to a specific pane using arrow keys:

<TryIt command="Ctrl-b ↑" />
<TryIt command="Ctrl-b ↓" />
<TryIt command="Ctrl-b ←" />
<TryIt command="Ctrl-b →" />

<Callout type="tip">
Arrow key navigation requires tmux 2.1+ (most modern systems). Older versions use `Ctrl-b q` then numbers.
</Callout>

## Quick pane selection

Show pane numbers:

<TryIt command="Ctrl-b q" />

Each pane displays a number briefly. Press the number to jump to that pane.

This is faster than arrow keys when you have many panes.

## Resizing panes

Resize the current pane:

<TryIt command="Ctrl-b Ctrl-↑" />
<TryIt command="Ctrl-b Ctrl-↓" />
<TryIt command="Ctrl-b Ctrl-←" />
<TryIt command="Ctrl-b Ctrl-→" />

Hold `Ctrl-b` and `Ctrl` together, then press arrow keys.

<Callout type="tip">
For finer control, use `Ctrl-b :` and type: `resize-pane -U 5` (up 5 lines), `-D 5` (down), `-L 5` (left), `-R 5` (right).
</Callout>

## Zooming panes

Temporarily maximize a pane:

<TryIt command="Ctrl-b z" />

The pane expands to fill the window. Press again to restore the original layout.

<Callout type="tip">
Use zoom for temporary fullscreen editing. `vim` in one pane, zoom to focus, then zoom out to see other panes.
</Callout>

## Closing panes

Close the current pane:

<TryIt command="exit" />

Or kill it:

<TryIt command="Ctrl-b x" />

Confirm with `y`.

<Callout type="warning">
Closing the last pane in a window closes the window. Be careful not to lose work!
</Callout>

## Pane layouts

tmux has predefined layouts that rearrange panes evenly:

<TryIt command="Ctrl-b Space" />

Cycle through layouts:
- **even-horizontal**: Panes stacked vertically (same width)
- **even-vertical**: Panes side by side (same height)
- **main-horizontal**: One large pane on top, others below
- **main-vertical**: One large pane on left, others on right
- **tiled**: All panes same size, arranged in grid

<Callout type="tip">
`main-vertical` is perfect for: main pane (vim/editor), side panes (tests, logs).
</Callout>

## Practical layouts

**Code + tests:**
```
┌─────────────┬─────────────┐
│  vim main   │  vim test   │
└─────────────┴─────────────┘
```
Create: `Ctrl-b %` (vertical split)

**Editor + logs:**
```
┌─────────────┐
│    vim      │
├─────────────┤
│  tail -f    │
└─────────────┘
```
Create: `Ctrl-b "` (horizontal split)

**Main + side panes:**
```
┌─────────┬───┬───┐
│         │   │   │
│   vim   │ t │ l │
│         │ e │ o │
│         │ s │ g │
│         │ t │ s │
└─────────┴───┴───┘
```
Create: `Ctrl-b "` then `Ctrl-b %` twice, use `main-vertical` layout

## Breaking panes into windows

Move a pane to its own window:

<TryIt command="Ctrl-b !" />

The pane becomes a new window.

## Joining panes

Move a pane from another window into the current one:

<TryIt command="Ctrl-b :` />

Then type: `join-pane -s sessionname:windowname.pane`

<Callout type="warning">
Pane joining syntax is verbose. Most users just close and recreate panes.
</Callout>

## Synchronizing panes

Type into all panes simultaneously:

<TryIt command="Ctrl-b :" />

Then type: `set-window-option synchronize-panes`

This is useful for running the same command on multiple servers.

<Callout type="tip">
Create a key binding for this in your `.tmux.conf`: `bind * set-window-option synchronize-panes`
</Callout>

## Key bindings summary

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `Ctrl-b %` | Split vertically (left/right) |
| `Ctrl-b "` | Split horizontally (top/bottom) |
| `Ctrl-b o` | Cycle to next pane |
| `Ctrl-b ↑↓←→` | Navigate with arrow keys |
| `Ctrl-b q` | Show pane numbers |
| `Ctrl-b Ctrl-↑↓←→` | Resize pane |
| `Ctrl-b z` | Zoom/unzoom pane |
| `Ctrl-b Space` | Cycle layouts |
| `Ctrl-b !` | Break pane to window |
| `Ctrl-b x` | Kill pane |

## Command-line usage

```bash
# Split current window
tmux split-window -v    # vertical split (top/bottom)
tmux split-window -h    # horizontal split (left/right)

# Select pane by index
tmux select-pane -t 0

# Resize pane
tmux resize-pane -U 5   # up 5 lines
tmux resize-pane -D 10  # down 10 lines

# Send keys to pane
tmux send-keys -t sessionname:windowname.pane "ls -la" Enter
```

## Common workflows

**Watching logs while coding:**
1. Split: `Ctrl-b "`
2. Bottom pane: `tail -f logs/app.log`
3. Top pane: edit code
4. Changes appear in logs as you work

**Side-by-side comparison:**
1. Split: `Ctrl-b %`
2. Left pane: `vim file1.ts`
3. Right pane: `vim file2.ts`
4. Compare implementations

**Testing workflow:**
1. Main pane: vim editor
2. Side pane: `npm test --watch`
3. See test results while editing

<Callout type="tip">
Panes + `zoom` (`Ctrl-b z`) give you focus when you need it, then context when you don't.
</Callout>
