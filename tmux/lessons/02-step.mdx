# Sessions

A tmux **session** is a container for windows and panes. Sessions are independent — each has its own set of windows and can be detached/attached separately.

Sessions are perfect for organizing work by project, server, or task.

## Creating sessions

Start a new session with a name:

<TryIt command="tmux new -s project-a" />

If you don't provide a name, tmux uses a number (0, 1, 2...).

<Callout type="tip">
Use descriptive names: `frontend`, `backend`, `prod-server`, `database-migration`.
</Callout>

## Listing sessions

From outside tmux:

<TryIt command="tmux ls" />

Output shows all sessions:

```
project-a: 1 windows (created Tue Feb  4 10:30:15 2025)
frontend: 2 windows (created Tue Feb  4 09:15:00 2025)
backend: 3 windows (created Tue Feb  4 08:45:30 2025) (attached)
```

Inside tmux, use the command mode:

<TryIt command="tmux list-sessions" />

Or press `Ctrl-b s` to switch to an interactive session list.

## Attaching to sessions

Attach to the most recent session:

<TryIt command="tmux attach" />

Attach to a specific session:

<TryIt command="tmux attach -t project-a" />

<Callout type="warning">
Only one session can be attached at a time in a single terminal. If `project-a` is already attached elsewhere, you'll need to detach it first or use `tmux attach -d -t project-a` to force detach elsewhere.
</Callout>

## Detaching from sessions

From inside tmux:

<TryIt command="Ctrl-b d" />

This is the **detach** key binding. The session keeps running in the background.

<Callout type="tip">
Think of detach as "minimize" — the session is still there, just not visible.
</Callout>

## Switching between sessions

While inside tmux, switch to another session:

<TryIt command="Ctrl-b s" />

This shows an interactive list. Use arrow keys to select, then press Enter.

Or switch directly:

<TryIt command="Ctrl-b ($)" />

This prompts for a session name.

## Renaming sessions

Rename the current session:

<TryIt command="Ctrl-b $" />

Or from command line:

<TryIt command="tmux rename-session -t project-a new-name" />

## Killing sessions

Close and delete a session from outside:

<TryIt command="tmux kill-session -t project-a" />

Kill all sessions:

<TryIt command="tmux kill-server" />

<Callout type="warning">
`kill-server` closes everything — all sessions, windows, panes. Use carefully.
</Callout>

## Practical workflow

Here's a common development workflow:

```bash
# Morning: start project session
tmux new -s project

# Do some work... (run tests, servers, etc.)

# Detach and go to lunch
Ctrl-b d

# Afternoon: reattach to where you left off
tmux attach -t project

# Everything is still running — servers, tests, vim sessions!
```

## Multiple session organization

Organize your work by creating separate sessions:

```bash
# Web development
tmux new -s frontend
tmux new -s backend

# Server work
tmux new -s prod-server
tmux new -s staging-db

# Learning/experimentation
tmux new -s experiments
```

Each session maintains its own state, windows, and layout.

## Session persistence

Sessions survive:

- Network disconnects (SSH drops)
- Closing your terminal window
- Logging out of a remote server
- Your computer going to sleep

This is why tmux is essential for remote work and long-running processes.

## Key bindings summary

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `Ctrl-b d` | Detach from session |
| `Ctrl-b s` | Choose session interactively |
| `Ctrl-b $` | Rename session |
| `Ctrl-b (` | Switch to previous session |
| `Ctrl-b )` | Switch to next session |

## Command-line summary

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `tmux new -s name` | Create new session |
| `tmux ls` | List sessions |
| `tmux attach` | Attach to most recent |
| `tmux attach -t name` | Attach to specific session |
| `tmux detach` | Detach (works inside tmux) |
| `tmux rename-session -t old new` | Rename session |
| `tmux kill-session -t name` | Kill a session |
| `tmux kill-server` | Kill all sessions |

<Callout type="tip">
Press `Ctrl-b :` to open command prompt, then type commands like `new-session`, `list-sessions`, `rename-session`. Tab-completion works here!
</Callout>
