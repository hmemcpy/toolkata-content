# What is tmux?

tmux is a **terminal multiplexer** — it creates and manages multiple terminal sessions from a single window. Think of it as a window manager for your terminal.

<Callout type="info">
The name comes from "terminal multiplexer" or "tmux" for short. It's pronounced "tee-mucks" but many developers just say "tmux".
</Callout>

## Why use tmux?

Before tmux, you needed multiple terminal windows or SSH connections to work on different things. tmux gives you:

- **Persistent sessions**: Programs keep running after you disconnect
- **Organization**: Group related work into sessions, windows, and panes
- **Efficiency**: Navigate between contexts without touching the mouse
- **Remote work**: Start something on a server, detach, and reattach later

## Installation

<TryIt command="tmux -V" />

If tmux is installed, you'll see the version number. If not, install it:

- **macOS**: `brew install tmux`
- **Ubuntu/Debian**: `sudo apt install tmux`
- **Fedora**: `sudo dnf install tmux`
- **Arch**: `sudo pacman -S tmux`

## Your first session

Start tmux with a named session:

<TryIt command="tmux new -s mysession" />

You're now inside a tmux session. The bottom status line shows:

```
[mysession] 0:bash*
```

- `[mysession]` is the session name
- `0:bash` is window index and name
- `*` marks the active window

You're in a normal shell — run commands like `ls`, `vim`, or any program. Everything runs inside tmux.

## Detach and reattach

The magic happens when you **detach** — leave tmux without closing programs:

<TryIt command="tmux detach" />

You're back at your normal terminal prompt. Any programs running in the session continue.

List your sessions:

<TryIt command="tmux ls" />

Reattach to pick up where you left off:

<TryIt command="tmux attach -t mysession" />

<Callout type="tip">
This is why tmux is indispensable for remote servers. Start a long-running process (builds, tests, servers), detach, go home, and reattach later.
</Callout>

## Prefix key

tmux uses a **prefix key** to distinguish tmux commands from shell commands. The default is `Ctrl-b`.

Press `Ctrl-b`, release both keys, then press the command key.

For example: `Ctrl-b d` detaches from the session.

<Callout type="warning">
Many users remap the prefix key. `Ctrl-b` is awkward (especially on keyboards where Ctrl requires reaching). Common alternatives: `Ctrl-a` (GNU screen's default) or `Ctrl-space`. We'll cover this in Step 7.
</Callout>

## Common commands

| Action | Command | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| Start session | `tmux new -s name` | Create new named session |
| Detach | `tmux detach` or `Ctrl-b d` | Leave session running |
| List sessions | `tmux ls` | Show all sessions |
| Attach | `tmux attach -t name` | Reattach to session |
| Kill session | `tmux kill-session -t name` | Close session |

## Key bindings (prefix = Ctrl-b)

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `d` | Detach from session |
| `?` | List all key bindings |
| `:` | Command prompt (enter commands by name) |

## Try it

1. Create a session: `tmux new -s test`
2. Run a long command: `sleep 300`
3. Detach: `Ctrl-b d`
4. List: `tmux ls` (you'll see `test` is still there)
5. Reattach: `tmux attach -t test` (your `sleep` is still running!)

<Callout type="tip">
Press `Ctrl-b ?` to see all key bindings. Press `q` or `Esc` to exit the help list.
</Callout>

## Clean up

When done, exit the session:

<TryIt command="exit" />

Or kill it from outside:

<TryIt command="tmux kill-session -t mysession" />
