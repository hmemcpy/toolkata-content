# Copy Mode

Copy mode lets you scroll through terminal output, search for text, and copy to a clipboard — all without a mouse.

This is essential when:
- You need to scroll back through long output
- You want to copy error messages or commands
- You're working on a remote server without mouse support

<Callout type="tip">
Copy mode is like `less` or `vim` for your terminal output.
</Callout>

## Entering copy mode

Enter copy mode:

<TryIt command="Ctrl-b [" />

You can now scroll up from your current position.

<Callout type="warning">
Copy mode shows output that has scrolled off screen. You can't copy what's currently visible — for that, just select text in your terminal emulator.
</Callout>

## Scrolling

**Line by line:**

<TryIt command="↑" />
<TryIt command="↓" />

**Page by page:**

<TryIt command="Ctrl-b" />  # page up
<TryIt command="Ctrl-f" />  # page down
<TryIt command="PageUp" />
<TryIt command="PageDown" />

**Jump to top/bottom:**

<TryIt command="g" />  # go to top
<TryIt command="G" />  # go to bottom

## Searching

Search forward:

<TryIt command="/" />

Type your search term, press Enter. Press `n` for next match, `N` for previous.

Search backward:

<TryIt command="?" />

Same behavior, but searches upward.

<Callout type="tip">
Search supports regex. Use `\bword\b` for whole-word matches.
</Callout>

## Copying text

1. Enter copy mode: `Ctrl-b [`
2. Navigate to start position with arrow keys or search
3. Start selection: `Space`
4. Move to end position (text is highlighted)
5. Copy selection: `Enter`

The text is now in tmux's paste buffer.

## Pasting

Paste the last copied text:

<TryIt command="Ctrl-b ]" />

This works in any pane or window — paste is session-wide.

## Vi mode vs Emacs mode

Copy mode uses **vi keys** by default. If you prefer emacs:

From command line:

<TryIt command="tmux set-window-option mode-keys emacs" />

<Callout type="tip">
Vi mode is more powerful but requires learning vi. Emacs mode uses familiar arrow keys.
</Callout>

## Copy mode commands (vi mode)

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `h` `j` `k` `l` | Left, down, up, right |
| `w` `b` | Forward/backward by word |
| `0` `$` | Start/end of line |
| `g` `G` | Start/end of buffer |
| `/` `?` | Search forward/backward |
| `n` `N` | Next/previous search result |
| `Space` | Start selection |
| `Enter` | Copy selection and exit |
| `q` `Esc` | Exit without copying |

## Copy mode commands (emacs mode)

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `↑` `↓` `←` `→` | Arrow keys |
| `Ctrl-b` `Ctrl-f` | Page up/down |
| `Ctrl-a` `Ctrl-e` | Start/end of line |
| `Alt-<` `Alt->` | Start/end of buffer |
| `Ctrl-s` `Ctrl-r` | Search forward/backward |
| `Ctrl-Space` | Start selection |
| `Ctrl-w` | Copy selection |
| `Enter` | Copy selection |
| `Esc` | Exit |

## Paste buffers

tmux keeps multiple paste buffers. List them:

<TryIt command="Ctrl-b =" />

Use arrow keys to select, Enter to paste.

## Copying between sessions

By default, paste buffers are per-session. To share across sessions:

<TryIt command="Ctrl-b :" />

Type: `set-buffer -b shared "text"`

Then in another session:

<TryIt command="Ctrl-b :" />

Type: `paste-buffer -b shared`

## Configuring scrollback

Increase scrollback history:

<TryIt command="Ctrl-b :" />

Type: `set-option -g history-limit 10000`

<Callout type="tip">
Set this permanently in `.tmux.conf`: `set -g history-limit 10000`
</Callout>

## Clearing history

Clear scrollback history:

<TryIt command="Ctrl-b :" />

Type: `clear-history`

## Capturing pane

Save entire pane contents to file:

<TryIt command="tmux capture-pane -t session:window.pane -S - -E - > output.txt" />

- `-S -`: Start from beginning
- `-E -`: End at end
- `> output.txt`: Redirect to file

## Scrolling with mouse

tmux supports mouse scrolling (requires configuration):

<TryIt command="Ctrl-b :" />

Type: `set-option -g mouse on`

Now you can:
- Scroll with mouse wheel
- Click to position cursor
- Select and copy with mouse

<Callout type="tip">
Mouse mode is convenient but slow. Keyboard-only is faster once learned.
</Callout>

## Practical examples

**Copy error message:**

```bash
# Run failing command
npm test

# Enter copy mode
Ctrl-b [

# Search for "Error"
/
Error

# Copy the error
Space (select)
Enter (copy)

# Paste elsewhere
Ctrl-b ]
```

**Copy command from earlier:**

```bash
# Scroll back
Ctrl-b [
k (up)

# Select command line
Space
0 (start of line)
$ (end of line)
Enter (copy)

# Paste to execute
Ctrl-b ]
```

## Copy mode workflows

**Reviewing build output:**
1. Build runs, scrolls off screen
2. Enter copy mode: `Ctrl-b [`
3. Search for "error" or "warning": `/error`
4. Review each match with `n`
5. Copy specific error to report

**Extracting data:**
1. Run command with table output
2. Enter copy mode, navigate to table
3. Copy rows with `Space` ... `Enter`
4. Paste into file or spreadsheet

**Documenting commands:**
1. Run successful command sequence
2. Enter copy mode
3. Copy each command with `0 $ Enter`
4. Paste into documentation
