# Learn tmux

tmux is a terminal multiplexer that lets you create and manage multiple terminal sessions from a single window. It's essential for remote servers, long-running processes, and organized development workflows.

## What you'll learn

This 8-step tutorial covers:

- **Sessions**: Create, detach, and reattach to persistent terminal sessions
- **Windows**: Manage multiple terminal windows within a session
- **Panes**: Split windows vertically and horizontally for parallel workflows
- **Navigation**: Move efficiently between sessions, windows, and panes
- **Copy Mode**: Scroll through output and copy text without a mouse
- **Configuration**: Customize tmux behavior with `.tmux.conf`
- **Scripting**: Automate session layouts and manage multiple projects

## Prerequisites

- Basic terminal familiarity (cd, ls, running commands)
- A Unix-like system (Linux, macOS, WSL)

## Why tmux?

tmux solves real problems that developers encounter daily:

- **Remote work**: Keep processes running after you disconnect from a server
- **Organization**: Group related work into named sessions (projects, servers, tasks)
- **Efficiency**: Navigate between contexts without leaving the keyboard
- **Resilience**: Network drops don't kill your work — just reattach to the session

## Getting started

tmux uses a **prefix key** (`Ctrl-b` by default) to distinguish its commands from shell commands. Press `Ctrl-b`, release, then press the command key.

For example: `Ctrl-b c` creates a new window.

The prefix key can be changed. Many users remap to `Ctrl-a` (screen's default) or `Ctrl-space` to avoid conflicts with shell readline shortcuts. We'll cover this in Step 7.
